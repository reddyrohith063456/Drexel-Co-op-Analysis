# Drexel Co-op Experience Analysis

**Project Type:** Data Analytics | NLP | Sentiment Analysis | Dashboard Visualization  
**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK), Tableau, Excel  

###  **What This Project Is About**
This project looks at feedback from Drexel University’s Co-op program between 2017 and 2020. The goal was to understand:

- What skills students gained or wanted to develop
- How experiences varied by major and year
- How students felt about their Co-op (positive, neutral, or negative)
- Patterns across citizenship and number of Co-op cycles
- I used natural language processing (NLP) to break down open-ended responses and created visual dashboards in Tableau to make everything easier to understand at a glance.

### **What the Data Shows**
**Top Skills Mentioned by Students:**

- Time management (24.79%) was the most common
- Others included networking, statistics, problem-solving, and economics

**Trends by Year:**

- Most Co-ops happened in 2018
- Participation was steady between 2017 and 2020

**Feedback Categories:**

- Responses were mostly about skills used, strengths, and areas for growth
- ECON, MKTG, ACCT, FIN, and MIS students gave the most responses

**What Students Felt** (Sentiment Analysis)
I used Python’s NLTK VADER tool to check how students felt about their experiences:

- 37.5% shared positive feedback
- 60.7% was neutral 
- Only 1.7% was negative
